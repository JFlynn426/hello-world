  <p class="myparagraphs">I have always loved technology ever since my father brought home one of the first Apple
    Computers. My passion for technology
    blossomed and I started building my own computers in about 2003. I have always loved learning how things work and
    the
    challenge of building computers and working with different applications facinated me. Shortly after Apple switched
    to
    <em>Intel processors</em> I started building hackintoshes. It was fun to work with the combination of hardware and
    basic
    code to get a self assembled computer to run the Mac Operating System.

  <p class="myparagraphs">I started school late after and began working as a laboratory technician at UConn where I was
    going to school. After years
    invested in going to school and working in various labs I realized that while I enjoy the academics and experiment
    design
    that it would require a lot of schooling to get a Ph.D.. With less and less money being devoted to biological
    research
    it became clear that finishing a college degree and a Ph.D. was going to take a long time for an uncertain future.
    I
    decided that I was going to try following a passion of mine: nature photography. While I enjoyed it very much, I
    learned
    that it would be difficult for me to make enough money to live the life that I wanted to live. I am not the best at
    marketing
    my material and myself and it is the primary component of being a successful nature photographer.

    <p class="lastp">I decided to look at one of my earlier passions, computers for a more practical way of supporting
      myself and my
      wife. I
      learned that I
      <em>love</em> coding. It allows me to exercize my love for logical problem solving on a daily basis.
