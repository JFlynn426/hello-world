      <h2>Sparking my interest</h2>
      <p class=info>In 2009 I traveled to Costa Rica with my wife with an old hand me down camera from my father. I
        loved
        seeing amazing wildlife
        in Costa Rica and the endless variation of thousands of different species residing in the Costa Rican
        Rainforest.
        While
        the pictures I took were frequently blurry or out of focus I discovered how much I enjoyed trying to take
        pictures
        and
        bring home photos of this magical place.

      <h2>Finding my passion</h2>
      <p>After my trip to Costa Rica I began brining my camera along when I would go out and explore. I started
        spending
        my
        time
        out in the Connecticut woods and reading in my free time about the ecology and natural variation in the state
        that
        I
        lived. It became important for me to find the most obscure species that I could culminating in my search for a
        critically
        endangered species in my state the Timber Rattlesnake. The Timber Rattlesnake had nearly been extirpated from
        Connecticut
        by homeowners killing the snakes when they entered their property and by people capturing them for the pet
        trade.
        It
        took nearly the entire summer but eventually I was rewarded with finding them in a small area in the largest
        park
        in
        the state.

      <h2>Mastering my passion</h2>
      <p>After thousands and thousands of hours, investment in better photography gear my pictures improved
        immensely.
        I
        have been
        published in magazines and sold thousands of dollars worth of photos.
